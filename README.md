# Brain Network Specialization through NSAR 2023

## Purpose

## Associated Publications 
<Coming Soon!>

## Getting Started 
Scripts are organized in the following folders: preproc, ind_parc, network_sa, and stats.

The preproc folder contains scripts for data organization, FreeSurfer, resting-state preprocessing (the CBIG2016 pipeline), and tSNR calculation. The ind_parc folder contains scripts for running the Kong2019 MS-HBM pipeline and visualization. The network_sa folder contains scripts for calculating network surface area using workbench_command. The stats folder contains scripts for manuscript figure generation and statistical analyses. README files can be found in each folder, so please see those for additional details.

## Tutorial Guide 
Step-by-step walkthroughs are avaialble for the preprocessing and MS-HBM parcellation steps on NeuroDocs (https://neurodocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Contact
For questions concerning script usage, please contact us through our lab webpage: https://brain.byu.edu/contact. Any questions regarding the usage of software/pipelines developed by other labs (e.g., fMRIprep) should be directed to their respective forums. Best of luck!
