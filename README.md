# Brain Network Specialization through NSAR 2023

## Purpose
The aim of this study was to estimate network specialization using a network surface area-based approach (NSAR). After examining the validity and reliability of individual network parcellations and this surface area-based measure of specialization, we addressed two hypotheses. First, we hypothesized that networks associated with language, visuospatial attention, and executive control would show the greatest specialization. Second, we hypothesized that network specialization relationships would follow one of three hypotheses: covariation, compensation, or independence.

## Getting Started 
Scripts are organized in the following folders: preproc, ind_parc, network_sa, validity, reliability, and stats.

The preproc folder contains scripts for data organization, FreeSurfer, resting-state preprocessing (the CBIG2016 pipeline), and tSNR calculation. The ind_parc folder contains scripts for running the Kong2019 MS-HBM pipeline and visualization. The network_sa folder contains scripts for calculating network surface area using workbench_command. The validity and reliability folders contain scripts used to run various validity and reliability analyses. The stats folder contains scripts for manuscript figure generation and statistical analyses. README files can be found in each folder, so please see those for additional details.

## Tutorial Guide 
Step-by-step walkthroughs are avaialble for the preprocessing and MS-HBM parcellation steps on NeuroDocs (neurodocs.readthedocs.io).
