# Reliability Analyses

## Description
Reliability analyses were used to examine NSAR within individuals. These included:
1. Stable estimate analysis. The aim of this analysis was to identify how much data is needed to generate a stable estimate of NSAR.
2. Test-retest analysis. The aim of this analysis was to identify the test-retest reliability of NSAR for a handful of specific networks.
3. Task effects analysis. The aim of this analysis was to identify a potential task effect (e.g., does task data produce different parcellation and NSAR results than resting-state data).

## Additional Notes
The scripts in these folders were used to do the heavy lifting for these analysis (e.g., generate the parcellations). Code for the statistical analysis can be found in the /stats folder.
