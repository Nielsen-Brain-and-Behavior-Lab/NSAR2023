# NSAR Validity Analyses

## Description 
While NSAR is similar to several asymmetry indices previously implemented (Binder et al., 1996; Braga et al., 2020; Mahowald & Fedorenko, 2016), its specific validity and reliability stand untested. The code in this folder was used to assess the validity of NSAR.  

## Contents
1. Convergent Validity: Comparison of NSAR against a different measure of specialization, the autonomy index
2. Ecological Validity: Comparison of HCP language network boundaries against a language atlas (LanA)
