# Convergent Validity Analysis (HCP dataset)

## Description
For the convergent validity analysis, NSAR was compared against another metric of lateralization: the autonomy index. The autonomy index was calculated following Wang et al. (2014), so subject-averaged functional connectivity matrices were first generated and then the autonomy index was calculated. Network boundaries were established using Kong2019 MS-HBM individual parcellations.
