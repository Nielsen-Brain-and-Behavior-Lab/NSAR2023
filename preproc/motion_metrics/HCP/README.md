# Motion Metrics Scripts for the HCP Dataset

## Description
Scripts used to compute mean framewise displacement, mean DVARS, and volumes remaining following CBIG2016 preprocessing. Scripts are optimized for Python/3.6.

## Contents
1. avg_FD.py
2. avg_DVARS.py
3. volumes_remaining.py

## Additional Notes
These scripts were used for HCP participants with all four runs of rs-fMRI data available post-preprocessing (N=232). However, highly similar scripts were used for HCP participants with less than four runs available.
