# tSNR Maps for the HCP Dataset

## Description
tSNR maps were generated by taking the mean BOLD signal and dividing it by the standard deviation in BOLD signal across all vertices for each participant. The tSNR was then averaged within network boundaries for each participant.

## Contents
1. ids.txt Text file containing anonymized subject IDs.
2. step1_fslmaths.sh Calculates tSNR for each run using mean BOLD signal divided by the standard deviation (requires CBIG2016 preproc output)
3. step2_surfproject.sh Projects tSNR maps from step 1 to the native surface
4. step3_loadgifti.m Generates a subject-averaged tSNR .mat file and .csv file containing the network-averaged tSNR for each subject (requires individual parcellations)

## Additional Notes
These scripts were written for the HCP subjects with all four runs remaining post-preprocessing. Highly similar scripts were used for the remainder of the HCP subjects.
